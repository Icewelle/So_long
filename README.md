A little game made in C.
Rules of the project were :
  - to count the number of moves we do
  - to have walls/obstacles that the player can't poass through
  - have coins that the player must take before exiting the lever
  - the coins HAVE to be collectable. If one was not accessible by the player the map is invalid.
  - The player must be able to go to the exit or the map is invalid
  - Other parsing stuff about the map to be sure the map given is valid

The project was not very big but still intersting. Learning how to create windows and handle display was kinda tricky with the tools we had.
